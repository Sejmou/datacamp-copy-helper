# DataCamp copy helper
This is a Chrome Extension adding features to easily create markdown documents from courses on DataCamp. It is based on a [TamperMonkey userscript](https://github.com/Sejmou/userscripts/blob/ff37ca9afe95b6fa3ebeb3a52190d5d32782bdbb/datacamp-copy-helper.js) I created for this purpose.

## Features
 * Copy content of various sub-pages of DataCamp courses to clipboard, including:
   - code exercises
   - drag/drop exercises
   - course overview
   - course videos

## WHY?
I created this extension solely for the purpose of reducing time spent with dumb copy-pasting in a course of the Data Science Master's degree at TU Wien. There we had an extremely lazy lecturer who basically just gave us a list of DataCamp courses that we should take. For each of those courses, we were tasked with creating a R Markdown file, were we essentially just had to copy all the stuff we did and explain what the code does.
